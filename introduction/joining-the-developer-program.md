# Joining the Developer Program

Before you can start developing addons for Squirrel you will require a Squirrel365 account and to have enrolled on the developer program.&#x20;

If you do not have a Squirrel account you can sign up for a free account here:\

Once signed up you will need to enrol on the developer program here:\

Once registered you will need to close and re-open Squirrel to unlock the developer addon
