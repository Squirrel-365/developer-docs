# Publishing an addon

Once you've built your addon and you're ready to make it available for others to use, you need to submit your addon to the Squirrel Marketplace. The Marketplace is a catalogue of all addons available in Squirrel. Other Squirrel users can browse and subscribe to addons to use in their projects. &#x20;

* To submit your addon you need to go to the [Developer Portal](https://cloud.squirrel365.io/account/main/developer/).
* Click on the "Create a new Addon" button
* Fill in all the form fields.
  * Public addons will be visible in the marketplace catalogue to all users, and will be crawlable by search engines.
  * Private addons will have a marketplace page but it will not be searchable in the catalogue or crawlable by search engines.
    * For private addons you have to [specify a list of email addresses](restricting-private-addons.md) of who can subscribe to your addon. Wildcards in the email addresses are permitted.&#x20;
* **Save and Preview** will save your addon submission as draft, and will show you what your marketplace page looks like
* **Save and Close** will just save your addon submission as draft.
* Once you're happy with your submission and how it looks on the marketplace page you can select **Save and Submit**. This will save your addon and alert the Squirrel365 team to review your submission.
  * Once reviewed you will receive an email to advise whether the addon passed or failed review.  If your addon failed the email will contain details on what the issues are.
* **Making it live**. Once your addon has been successfully reviewed it will be in a "passed review" status.  You can then manually mark your addon as "live".
  * If yours is a "public addon" then this will immediately add your marketplace page to the catalogue and your addon will be viewable to others.&#x20;
  * If yours is a "private addon" then the "subscribe" button on the private marketplace page will become active.
